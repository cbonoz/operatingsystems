# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

We mirrored the forking implementation in lab 1 to enable parallel downloads and uploads.


# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

1. Fixed buffer overflow that could occur if the user's filename size is greater than the size of our filename buffer (returns an error if the requested filename is too long on the command line).
2. Added a check for the t->filename not to exceed the size of the disk filename size
3. 

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

1. Capped the file download size that could be initiated (limited to 2ÃŸ0MB) to prevent attackers from loading the disk with single requests. If you want larger files than this, can do partial file downloads that still fit within this cap.
